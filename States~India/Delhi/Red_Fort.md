> The Red Fort, also known as Lal Qila (Hindi pronunciation: [laːl 'qɪlaː]), 
> is an historic Mughal fort located in the Old Delhi area of Delhi, India. 
> It served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors. 
> 
> Commissioned by Emperor Shah Jahan on the 12th of May 1639, 
> the fort was constructed following his decision 
> to shift the Mughal capital from Agra to Delhi. 
> 
> Originally adorned in red and white, 
> the fort's design is attributed to Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the architect of the Taj Mahal. 
> The Red Fort is a prominent example of Mughal architecture from Shah Jahan's reign, 
> combining Persian and Indian architectural styles.
>
> During the invasion by Nadir Shah of the Afsharid Empire in 1739, 
> the fort was plundered and stripped of its artwork and jewels. 
> 
> Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, 
> many of its marble structures were demolished by the British, 
> although the defensive walls remained largely intact. 
> The fort was later repurposed as a military garrison.
>
> On 15 August 1947, the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, 
> hoisted the Indian flag above the Lahori Gate, the main entrance of the Red Fort. 
> Since then, the Prime Minister of India has ceremonially raised the national tricolour 
> at the main gate each year on Independence Day, 
> then delivering a nationally broadcast address from its ramparts.
>
> The Red Fort, as part of the Red Fort Complex, 
> was recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007.
