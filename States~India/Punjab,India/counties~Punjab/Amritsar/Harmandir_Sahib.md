> The Golden Temple is a gurdwara located in Amritsar, Punjab, India. 
> It is the pre-eminent spiritual site of Sikhism. 
> It is one of the holiest sites in Sikhism, 
> alongside the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Kartarpur, 
> and Gurdwara Janam Asthan in Nankana Sahib.
>
> The sarovar (holy pool) on the site of the gurdwara 
> was completed by the fourth Sikh Guru, Guru Ram Das, in 1577. 
> In 1604, Guru Arjan, the fifth Sikh Guru, placed a copy of the Adi Granth 
> in the Golden Temple and was a prominent figure in its development. 
> 
> The gurdwara was repeatedly rebuilt by the Sikhs after it became a target of persecution 
> and was destroyed several times by the Mughal and invading Afghan armies. 
> Maharaja Ranjit Singh, after founding the Sikh Empire, rebuilt it in marble and copper in 1809, 
> and overlaid the sanctum with gold leaf in 1830. 
> This has led to the name the Golden Temple.
>
> The Golden Temple is spiritually the most significant shrine in Sikhism. 
> It became a centre of the Singh Sabha Movement between 1883 and the 1920s, 
> and the Punjabi Suba movement between 1947 and 1966. 
> 
> In the early 1980s, the gurdwara became a centre of conflict between the Indian government 
> and a radical movement led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. 
> 
> In 1984, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi sent in the Indian Army as part of Operation Blue Star, 
> leading to the deaths of thousands of soldiers, militants and civilians, 
> as well as causing significant damage to the gurdwara 
> and the destruction of the nearby Akal Takht. 
> The gurdwara complex was rebuilt again after the 1984 attack on it.
>
> The Golden Temple is an open house of worship for all people, from all walks of life and faiths. 
> It has a square plan with four entrances, and a circumambulation path around the pool. 
> The four entrances of the gurudwara symbolise the Sikh belief in equality and the Sikh view that people from all groups, castes and ethnicities are welcome at their holy place. The complex is a collection of buildings around the sanctum and the pool. One of these is Akal Takht, the chief centre of religious authority of Sikhism. Additional buildings include a clock tower, the offices of the Gurdwara Committee, a Museum and a langar – a free Sikh community-run kitchen that offers a vegetarian meal to all visitors without discrimination. Over 150,000 people visit the shrine every day for worship. The gurdwara complex has been nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and its application is pending on the tentative list of UNESCO.
