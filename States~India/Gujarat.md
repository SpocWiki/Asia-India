> **Gujarat** (Gujarati: Gujarāt, pronounced [ˈɡudʒəɾaːt] ) is a state along the western coast of India. 
> 
> Its coastline of about 2,340 km (1,450 mi) is the longest in the country, 
> most of which lies on the Kathiawar peninsula. 
> Gujarat is the fifth-largest Indian state by area, covering some 196,024 km2 (75,685 sq mi); 
> and the ninth-most populous state, with a population of 60.4 million in 2011. 
> 
> It is bordered by Rajasthan to the northeast, Dadra and Nagar Haveli 
> and Daman and Diu to the south, Maharashtra to the southeast, Madhya Pradesh to the east, 
> and the Arabian Sea and the Pakistani province of Sindh to the west. 
> 
> Gujarat's capital city is Gandhinagar, while its largest city is Ahmedabad. 
> The Gujaratis are indigenous to the state, 
> and their language, Gujarati, is the state's official language.
>
> The state encompasses 23 sites of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation (more than any other state). 
> 
> The most important sites are Lothal (the world's first dry dock), Dholavira (the fifth largest site), 
> and Gola Dhoro (where five uncommon seals were found). 
> 
> Lothal is believed to have been one of the world's first seaports. 
> Gujarat's coastal cities, chiefly Bharuch and Khambhat, 
> served as ports and trading centres in the Maurya and Gupta empires, 
> and during the succession of royal Saka dynasties in the Western Satraps era.
>
> Along with Bihar, Mizoram and Nagaland, Gujarat is one of four Indian states to prohibit the sale of alcohol. The Gir National Park in Gujarat is home to the only wild population of the Asiatic lion in the world.
>
> The economy of Gujarat is the fifth-largest in India, with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of ₹16.55 trillion (equivalent to ₹19 trillion or US$220 billion in 2023) and has the country's 10th-highest GSDP per capita of ₹215,000 (US$2,500). Gujarat has the highest exports of all states, accounting for around one-third of national exports. It ranks 21st among Indian states and union territories in human development index. The world's largest data center will also be built in Jamnagar, Gujarat, by Reliance Industries. Gujarat is regarded as one of the most industrialised states and has a low unemployment rate. The state has one of the lowest crime rates, with Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Surat crowned among the five safest cities in India.
