> The Satavahanas (; Sādavāhana or Sātavāhana, IAST: Sātavāhana), 
> also referred to as the Andhras (also Andhra-bhṛtyas or Andhra-jatiyas) in the Puranas, 
> were an ancient Indian dynasty. 
> 
> Most modern scholars believe that the Satavahana rule began in the late 2nd century BCE 
> and lasted until the early 3rd century CE, although some assign the beginning of their rule to 
> as early as the 3rd century BCE based on the Puranas, 
> but uncorroborated by archaeological evidence. 
> 
> The Satavahana kingdom mainly comprised the present-day 
> - Andhra Pradesh, 
> - Telangana, and 
> - Maharashtra. 
> 
> At different times, their rule extended to parts of modern 
> - Gujarat, 
> - Madhya Pradesh, and 
> - Karnataka. 
> 
> The dynasty had different capital cities at different times, including 
> - Pratishthana (Paithan) and 
> - Amaravati (Dharanikota).
>
> The origin of the dynasty is uncertain, but according to the Puranas, 
> their first king overthrew the Kanva dynasty. 
> 
> In the post-Maurya era, the Satavahanas established peace in the Deccan region 
> and resisted the onslaught of foreign invaders. 
> 
> In particular their struggles with the Saka (Western Satraps) went on for a long time. 
> The dynasty reached its zenith under the rule of Gautamiputra Satakarni 
> and his successor Vasisthiputra Pulamavi. 
> 
> The kingdom had fragmented into smaller states by the early 3rd century CE.
>
> The Satavahanas were early issuers of Indian state coinage struck with images of their rulers. 
> They formed a cultural bridge and played a vital role in trade 
> and the transfer of ideas and culture to and from the Indo-Gangetic Plain 
> to the southern tip of India.
