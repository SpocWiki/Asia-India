> Narendra Damodardas Modi (born 17 September 1950) is an Indian politician 
> who has served as the  prime minister of India since 2014. 
> 
> Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 
> and is the member of parliament (MP) for Varanasi. 
> 
> He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) 
> and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), 
> a right-wing Hindutva paramilitary volunteer organisation. 
> He is the longest-serving prime minister outside the Indian National Congress.
>
> Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat), 
> where he completed his secondary education. 
> 
> He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight, 
> becoming a full-time worker for the organisation in Gujarat in 1971. 
> 
> The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985, and he rose through the party hierarchy, 
> becoming general secretary in 1998. 
> 
> In 2001, Modi was appointed chief minister of Gujarat 
> and elected to the legislative assembly soon after. 
> 
> His administration is considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots 
> and has been criticised for its management of the crisis. 
> 
> According to official records, a little over 1,000 people were killed, 
> three-quarters of whom were Muslim; 
> independent sources estimated 2,000 deaths, mostly Muslim. 
> 
> A Special Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India in 2012 
> found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against him. 
> While his policies as chief minister were credited for encouraging economic growth, 
> his administration was criticised for 
> failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state.
>
> In the 2014 Indian general election, Modi led the BJP to a parliamentary majority, 
> the first for a party since 1984. 
> 
> His administration increased direct foreign investment 
> and reduced spending on healthcare, education, and social-welfare programs. 
> 
> Modi began a high-profile sanitation campaign 
> and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. 
> 
> His demonetisation of banknotes in 2016 
> and introduction of the Goods and Services Tax in 2017 sparked controversy. 
> 
> Modi's administration launched the 2019 Balakot airstrike 
> against an alleged terrorist training camp in Pakistan; 
> the airstrike failed, but the action had nationalist appeal. 
> 
> Modi's party won the 2019 general election which followed. 
> In its second term, his administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir 
> and introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act, 
> prompting widespread protests and spurring the 2020 Delhi riots 
> in which Muslims were brutalised and killed by Hindu mobs. 
> 
> Three controversial farm laws led to sit-ins by farmers across the country, 
> eventually causing their formal repeal. 
> 
> Modi oversaw India's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
> during which, according to the World Health Organization, 4.7 million Indians died. 
> 
> In the 2024 general election, Modi's party lost its majority in the lower house of Parliament 
> and formed a government leading the National Democratic Alliance coalition. 
> 
> Following a terrorist attack in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir, 
> Modi presided over the 2025 India–Pakistan conflict, which resulted in a ceasefire.
>
> Under Modi's tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding 
> and has shifted towards an authoritarian style of government, 
> with a cult of personality centred around him. 
> 
> As prime minister, he has received consistently high approval ratings within India. 
> Modi has been described as engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics. 
> He remains a highly controversial figure domestically 
> and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and handling of the Gujarat riots, 
> which have been cited as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda.
