> The Sikh Empire was a regional power based in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent. 
> It existed from 1799, when Maharaja Ranjit Singh captured Lahore, to 1849, 
> when it was defeated and conquered by the British East India Company following the Second Anglo-Sikh War. 
> 
> At its peak in the mid-19th century the empire extended from Gilgit and Tibet in the north 
> to the deserts of Sindh in the south and from the Khyber Pass in the west 
> to the Sutlej in the east, and was divided into eight provinces. 
> 
> Religiously diverse, with an estimated population of 4.5 million in 1831 
> (making it the 19th most populous state at the time), 
> it was the last major region of the Indian subcontinent to be annexed by the British Empire.
>
> In 1799, Ranjit Singh of Sukerchakia Misl captured Lahore from the Sikh triumvirate 
> which had been ruling it since 1765, and was confirmed on the possession of Lahore by the Durrani ruler, Zaman Shah. He was formally crowned on 12 April 1801  by Sahib Singh Bedi, a descendant of Guru Nanak. Ranjit Singh rose to power in a very short period, from a leader of a single misl to finally becoming the Maharaja of Punjab. By 1813 all the remaining Sikh misls had been annexed by Ranjit Singh, and the following years saw progressive expulsion of the Afghans from Punjab; the Afghan influence east of Indus ended after the fall of Multan in 1818. In the subsequent decades Durrani Afghans lost Kashmir and Peshawar to the Sikhs as well. By 1840 Ladakh and Baltistan had been brought under Sikh suzerainty by Gulab Singh. Ranjit Singh modernised his army using the latest training as well as weapons and artillery. 
>
> After the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1839, the empire was weakened by the British East India Company stoking internal divisions and political mismanagement. Finally, in 1849, the state was dissolved after its defeat in the Second Anglo-Sikh War.
