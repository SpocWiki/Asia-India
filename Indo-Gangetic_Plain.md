## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Indo-Gangetic Plain, also known as the Northern Plain or North Indian River Plain, 
> is a fertile plain spanning 700,000 km2 (270,000 sq mi) 
> across the northern and north-eastern part of the Indian subcontinent. 
> It encompasses northern and eastern India, eastern Pakistan, southern Nepal, 
> and almost all of Bangladesh. 
> It is named after the two major river systems that drain the region–Indus and Ganges.
>
> It stretches from the Himalayas in the north 
> to the northern edge of the Deccan plateau in the south, 
> and extends from North East India in the east to the Iranian border in the west. 
> 
> The region is home to many major cities and nearly one-seventh of the world's population. 
> As the region was formed by the deposits of the three major rivers–
> Indus, Ganges and Brahmaputra, 
> the plains consists of the world's largest expanse of uninterrupted alluvium. 
> Due to its rich water resources, it is one of the world's most densely populated 
> and intensely farmed areas.
